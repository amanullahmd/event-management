A three‑dashboard setup is exactly how professional ticketing platforms (Eventbrite, Universe, Ticketmaster Organizer Tools) structure their systems. Each role needs a different view, different permissions, and different workflows. Let’s map out **clean, production‑ready frontend documentation** for all three dashboards: **Admin**, **Organizer**, and **Customer**.

This will give you a clear blueprint for UI, routing, permissions, and component structure.

# **🔐 Role-Based Access (Frontend)**

### **Admin**
```ts
role === "ADMIN"
```

### **Organizer**
```ts
role === "ORGANIZER"
```

### **Customer**
```ts
role === "CUSTOMER"
```

### **Route Protection Example**
```ts
export function requireRole(role: string) {
  const user = await apiGet("/auth/me");
  if (user.role !== role) redirect("/unauthorized");
  return user;
}
```
